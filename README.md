# PPR Océan & Climat Data Challenge 1

Emulation of Global Ocean Reanalyses

## Task description

Creating  neural  emulators  of  global  ocean  dynamics,  which  reproduce  the  time evolution  of  the  global  3D  state  vector,  given  perfectly  known  initial  conditions and time-varying forcings.

## Getting started

Check out the quick-start guide **[TODO: add link]** or the complete API docs **[TODO: add link]** for an extensive look into its functionality.

## What is the PPR Océan & Climat?

It is a *Priority Research Project* launched by the French government and managed by the CNRS and Ifremer.
The project aims to structure French research forces to improve our understanding of the ocean and our protection efforts.
See the [project website](https://www.ocean-climat.fr/) (in French) for more details.
